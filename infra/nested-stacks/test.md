## __SPE QA Automation Project - Key Points Summary__

__🎯 Goal__: Automate end-to-end QA testing using LLM agents - from JIRA tickets to self-healing test execution

__🏗️ 5-Stage Pipeline__:

1. __JIRA → Test Cases__: Webhooks trigger LLM to generate test cases from acceptance criteria
2. __Test Scripts__: LLM creates executable scripts, checks into Git
3. __Existing DevOps__: Current SPE pipeline runs Playwright tests (no changes)
4. __Results Processing__: S3 events trigger automated report analysis
5. __Self-Healing__: LLM analyzes failures, attempts fixes, stores learnings

__🔧 Tech Stack__:

- AWS (Step Functions, Fargate/Lambda, S3, EventBridge)
- Bedrock Agents with Nova Pro/Premiere (multi-modal for video analysis)
- Terraform infrastructure

__📊 Resources__: 4 months, ~100 hrs/week total

- Engagement Mgr (20h), Security (10h), Infrastructure (10-20h), LLM Engineer (40h)

__🎯 Applications__:

- Primary: Consolidation project (120 APIs automated, manual test cases available)
- Secondary: RPM (existing UI automation)

__⚡ Next Steps__: Sandbox setup → detailed architecture discussions → repository access after approval

__💡 Benefits__: Faster testing, better coverage, self-healing, frees QA for higher-value work
